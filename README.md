# Introduction to Global Climate Change
A cool, informative web-based project that visualizes key climate change data like global temperature, CO2 emissions by country, and sea level rise using interactive charts. With datasets from NASA, NOAA, and the GCP, we analyze century-long trends and regional variations to highlight the urgency of addressing climate change. Explore how these factors are interconnected and gain insights into the historical progression of the global climate crisis.

- I finished up all of the global styling, so all y'all gotta do is plug and play with the charts
- But you're also gonna have to explain your visualizations, prolly more than me to get to the conclusion portion
- Also note that y'all gotta have these too: 
    - We expect at least one linked interaction between two views. (this is from the last lab)
    - We expect at least one innovative/advanced visualization (i.e., not
    standard visualizations that can be easily created in Tableau or
    Excel). (idk about this one, good luck LOL, prolly look at the examples from the slides from 10-7)
