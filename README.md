# Introduction to Global Climate Change
A cool, informative web-based project that visualizes key climate change data like global temperature, CO2 emissions by country, and sea level rise using interactive charts. With datasets from NASA, NOAA, and the GCP, we analyze century-long trends and regional variations to highlight the urgency of addressing climate change. Explore how these factors are interconnected and gain insights into the historical progression of the global climate crisis.
